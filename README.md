  <i>I’m a curious and driven developer, always learning and building.</i>

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I have always been passionate about technology, constantly amazed by the little discoveries that fuel my curiosity.  
Problem-solving fascinates me(too much maybe),since childhood, I’ve enjoyed puzzles, riddles, and strategy games. This passion naturally led me to programming, which I see as a powerful tool for tackling complex challenges.

I also have a strong vocation for teaching, having worked as a private math tutor, a subject I greatly enjoy.

🎯 In the short term, my goal is to expand my knowledge across different areas of the tech industry, to gain a well-rounded understanding.  
🚀 In the long run, I aim to refine my skills and specialize in a specific field, continuously growing as a professional.

> 💼 **Currently looking for job opportunities** where I can keep learning and contributing.
